REV02 is obsolete. There is no reason to build it now that REV3 is available.
REV02 has an RC network to filter CW sidetone to the (now obsolete) uLCD-32PTU display.

REV03 is obsolete.
REV03 differs from REV2 in that:
a) it has 4 layers for better RF immunity.
b) it has a place for a 5V sounder for CW sidetone.

REV04 adds SMD pads for all the resistors, capacitors, transistor and regulator
