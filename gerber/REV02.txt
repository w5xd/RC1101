The gerber files are formatted as RS-274-X files. The drill file includes the hole size definitions. 
The diameters listed refer to the finished hole sizes after plating, not the drill size.

Each file can be identify by its extension:

.TSK or .SLK = top silkscreen layer
.TSM or .SMT = top solder mask layer
.TOP = top copper layer
.GTP = top paste layer
.IPT or .INT = top inner copper layer
.BOT = bottom copper layer
.IPB or INB = bottom inner copper layer
.BSM or .SMB = bottom solder mask layer
.GBP = bottom paste layer
.DRI = drill file
.OLN = board outline
