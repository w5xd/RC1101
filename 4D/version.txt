First line of this file MUST consist of 8 hexadecimal digits and only CAPS
for A-F. This number is read from the RC-1101 on its GetLcdImageVersion method.
Even numbers reserved for GEN4 images, odd numbers for uLCD32

For RC-1101's with firmware prior to that distributed with WriteLog version
12.50, the selection of rig types that the RC-1101 can display is limited
to those rigs in the file RunFlash.4xe. This is because older versions of
the firmware always only load RunFlash.4xe, but, after 12.50, not all 
rig types fit in one .4xe file. For the older firmware, you may copy:
    TS590K3.4xe to RunFlash.4xe and the TS590, K3 and K2 are supported.
    IcomFlex.4xe to RunFlash.4xe and the Icom and FlexRadio rigs are supported.
